# Network-Community-Detection-App
Network Community Detection App implemented in Shiny and based on qgraph and igraph R Packages

This app visualizes networks based on the qgraph package in R (Epskamp et al., 2017). 
Furthermore, it can detect communities (via the igraph package in R; Csardi, 2015) 
in the graph and visualizes the results in a novel qgraph-compatible way.

For further information regarding the background and use of the app, you can consult the manual.
